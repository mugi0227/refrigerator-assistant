// swift-tools-version: 5.9
//
// swift-litert-lm — LiteRT-LM on iPhone, the easy way, and as an Apple
// Foundation Models backend.
//
// This package layers two faces on top of Google's official LiteRT-LM runtime:
//   • Easy mode  — `LiteRTChat(.gemma4_E2B)`: auto-download, memory-safe, GPU.
//   • FM mode    — `LiteRTLanguageModel`: an Apple Foundation Models backend
//                  (added in a later phase; needs the iOS 27 SDK).
//
// The native runtime ships as prebuilt xcframeworks attached to the official
// LiteRT-LM GitHub releases. We depend on those binary artifacts directly
// (they download cleanly over HTTPS) and vendor the official thin Swift
// wrapper under `Sources/LiteRTLM` (Apache-2.0; see NOTICE). We deliberately do
// NOT add `google-ai-edge/litert-lm` as a SwiftPM git dependency: that repo
// LFS-tracks Android/Linux/Windows prebuilt libs (`prebuilt/*/*.so` …) which
// are irrelevant to Apple platforms but make `swift package resolve` fragile
// (see upstream issue #2407). Binary targets keep the on-ramp bulletproof.
